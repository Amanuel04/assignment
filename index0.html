        The track record of construction industry is very poor in terms of managing risks, resulting in the failure of many projects to meet time schedules, targets of budget and sometimes even the scope of work. As a result, a lot of suffering is inflicted to the clients and contractors of such projects and also to the general public. 

Risk in the construction adversely affects the project objectives of time, cost, scope and quality. Some risks in construction processes can be easily predicted or readily identified; still some can be totally unforeseen. 

Construction risks can be related to design, physical, logistics, legal, environmental, management, financial, construction, political. Compared with many other industries, the construction industry is subject to more risks due to the unique features of construction activities, such as long period, complicated processes, terrible environment, financial intensity and dynamic organization structures (Flanagan and Norman, 1993; Akintoye and MacLeod, 1997; Smith, 2003).

“Risk” is defined as the chance of an adverse event depending on the circumstances (Butler, 1982). Risk is perceived as ‘the potential for unwanted or negative consequences of an event or activity'(Rowe, 1977), a combination of hazard and exposure (Chicken and Posner, 1998). 

There are many risks involved in construction projects. These risks could be attributed to a number of reasons, which include the nature of the construction process, the complexity and time-consuming design and construction activities, and the involvement of a multitude of people from different organizations with different skills and interests. Hence, a great deal of effort is required to co-ordinate the wide range of activities that are undertaken.
 
Accordingly, construction industry is one of the most important and job creating industries in all countries. Compared to other economic-industrial sectors, construction management is highly influenced by the perception and employment of risk management concept.

Risk management is ‘a system which aims to identify and quantify all risks to which the business or project is exposed so that a conscious decision can be taken on how to manage the risks'(Flanagan and Norman, 1993).

To distinguish the concepts of risk, certainty, and uncertainty, and is consistent with the literature (ASCE, 1979; CIRA, 1994; Kangari, 1995; Hastak and Shaked, 2000; PMI, 2001; Smith, 2001) on what is considered as the sequential procedures for construction risk management: 1) identification, 2) assessment, 3) analysis of impact, and 4) management response.

The value of systematic risk management of project activity is not fully recognized by the construction industry (Walewski et al., 2002) . Since no common view of risk exists, owners, investors, designers, and constructors have differing objectives and adverse relationships between the parties are common. Attempts at coordinating risk analysis management between all of the project participants have not been formalized and this is especially true between contractors and owners.

Risk Management is an important process in any capital project (Krane, 2010), particularly construction projects. Thus, Risk Management is currently one of the main topics of interest for both researchers and construction practitioners (Raz, 2002).

Risk management may be described as “a systematic way of looking at areas of risk and consciously determining how each should be treated. It is a management tool that aims at identifying sources of risk and uncertainty, determining their impact, and developing appropriate management responses” (Uher,2003). The aim of each organization is to be successful and Risk Management can facilitate it. However it should be underlined that Risk Management is not a tool which ensures success but rather a tool which helps to increase the probability of achieving success. Risk management is therefore a proactive rather than a reactive concept. 
Managing risks involves identifying, assessing and prioritizing risks by monitoring, controlling, and applying managerial resources with a coordinated and economical effort so as to minimize the probability and/or impact of unfortunate events and so as to maximize the realization of project objectives (Douglas, 2009). Risk management, which has been practiced since the mid-1980s, is one of the nine main knowledge areas of the project management institute’s project management body of knowledge.

(Tuyszet, 2006). Effective Risk Management may lead the project manager to several benefits such as identification of favorable alternative course of action, increased confidence in achieving project objective, improved chances of success, reduced surprises, more precise estimates (through reduced uncertainty), reduced duplication of effort (through team awareness of risk control actions), etc. (Bannerman,2008). Systemic Risk Management has an effect on the project success.

Construction risk is generally perceived as events that influence project objectives of cost, time and quality. Roozbeh Kangari (Dec 1995) "Risk Management Perceptions and trends of U.S Construction" discussed the attit
