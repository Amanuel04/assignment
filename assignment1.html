        <b>C++</b> is widely used in general-purpose programming languages. The language allows you to<br> 
        encapsulate high and low-level language features. So, it is seen as an intermediate-level language. <br>
        It also used to develop complex systems where the hardware level coding requires.
    <li>C++ is multi-paradigm means it follows three paradigms Generic, Imperative, and Object-Oriented.
    <li>C++ provides performance and memory efficiency.
    <li>It provides high-level abstraction.
    <li>C++ is compatible with C.
    <li>The language allows the reusability of code. <br><br>

    <b>Python</b> is a high-level object-oriented programming language. It has built-in data structures, combined with dynamic binding<br>
 and typing, which makes it an ideal choice for rapid application development. Python also offers support for modules and packages, <br>
 which allows system modularity and code reuse.It is one of the fastest programming languages as it requires very few lines of code. <br>
 Its emphasis is on readability and simplicity, which make it a great choice for beginners.
	<li>Very simple syntax compared to Java, C, and C++ languages.
        <li>	It is used for Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and the general overarching AI field.
            <li>	Very useful in data analysis and visualization.
                <li>Extensive library and handy tools for developers/programmer
                    <li>	Python is cross-compatible
                        <li>	Python has its auto-installed shell
                            <li>	Compared with the code of other languages, python code is easy to write and debug. Therefore, its source code is relatively easy to maintain.
                                <li>	Python is a portable language so that it can run on a wide variety of Operating systems and platforms.
                                    <li>Python comes with many prebuilt libraries, which makes your development task easy.
                                        <li>	Python helps you to make complex programming simpler. As it internally deals with memory addresses, garbage collection.
                                            <li>Python provides an interactive shell that helps you to test the things before itâ€™s actual implementation.
                                                <li>	Python offers database interfaces to all major commercial DBMS systems.
                                                    <li>	Supports imperative and functional programming
                                                        <li>	Python is famous for its use in IoT.
<br><br>

KEY DIFFERENCES:
<li>Python code runs through an interpreter while C++ code is pre-compiled
    <li>Python supports Garbage Collection whereas C++ does not support Garbage Collection
        <li>Python is slower, on the other hand, C++ is faster than Python
            <li>	In Python, Rapid Prototyping is possible because of the small size of the code while in C++, Rapid Prototyping not possible because of larger code size
                <li>Python is easy to learn language whereas C++ has a stiff learning curve as it has lots of predefined syntaxes and structure
